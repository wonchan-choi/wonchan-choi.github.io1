I am an assistant professor of [Information Studies](https://uwm.edu/informationstudies/) at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM). My research program involves studies of <b>information behavior</b> and <b>human-computer interaction</b>. I'm interested in the interactions among people, technology, and information in the context of users acquiring necessary information to address various problems encountered during their everyday lives. I emphasize the role of people as the central actors in interactions among the three components of information science and technology. 

My [current projects](projects.md) focus on:
- Credibility assessment of online information on social media
- Generative artificial intelligence literacy
- Usability and accessibility of information systems for disadvantaged user groups
