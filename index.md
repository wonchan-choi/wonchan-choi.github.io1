I am an assistant professor at the [iSchool](https://uwm.edu/informationstudies/), University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM). My research program involves studies of <b>information behavior</b> and <b>human-computer interaction</b>. My research aims to understand the interactions among people, technology, and information in the context of users acquiring necessary information to address various problems encountered during their everyday lives. I emphasize the role of people as the central actors in interactions among the three components of information science and technology (IST). People (users) are therefore considered the starting and end points of my research. Technology is seen as the interface through which users access information or the medium for delivering information and information services to users. 
My current projects focus on:
- <b>Credibility assessment of online information</b> One of my primary research interests involves the credibility of online information, commonly referred to as web credibility. In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving online landscape, where content generated by anonymous users and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered bots circulates freely, web credibility plays a crucial role in the process of seeking and using information. Although the concept of credibility has long been studied in various fields, new online systems and services present new challenges and require new mechanisms for credibility communication and assessment.
Currently, I am working on a project to develop a platform-specific framework on collaborative peer knowledge-production sites, such as social question-and-answer sites, as a unique and useful source of online information (funded by UWM Research Assistance Fund; CV item 3.9.7). This project involves developing a theoretical framework (CV items 3.1.17 and 3.11.31) and testing and revising it using empirical data (CV items 3.11.32 and 3.11.33).
Another ongoing project addresses credibility issues with AI-generated content
- <b>Generative AI Literacy</b>
- <b>Usability and accessibility of information systems for disadvantaged user groups</b>
