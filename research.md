## Current Projects
### [Universal Accessibility and Usability of Digital Libraries in the Mobile Environment: Developing design guidelines to support blind and visually impaired users](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-252289-ols-22)
- Funding: IMLS Leadership Grants for Libraries Applied Research (August 2023–July 2025), $695,631 
- Investigators:
  - [Iris Xie](https://uwm.edu/informationstudies/directory/xie-iris/) (PI), Professor, iSchool@UWM
  - **Wonchan Choi (Co-PI)**, Assistant Professor, iSchool@UWM
- Description: This project aims to create mobile digital library accessibility and usability guidelines to support blind and visually impaired users. This project will generate a new framework including a theoretical approach that considers all users’ needs; types of help-seeking situations blind and visually impaired users encounter using mobile digital libraries; limitations of the existing mobile digital library guidelines; mobile digital library accessibility and usability guidelines addressing each situation; current digital libraries compliance status; and methodology to be applied to develop guidelines supporting other underserved groups. The project will help policymakers, researchers, and practitioners understand digital library design problems and enable developers to enhance digital libraries for universal access.

### [Rethinking Digital Literacy in the Age of Generative AI: College Students’ Use of ChatGPT for Educational Purposes](https://uwm.edu/community-engagement-professions/ccep-announces-research-seed-funding-awards/)
- Funding: UWM CCEP Research Seed Funding Awards (July 2023–June 2024), $6,000
- Principal Investigators:
  - **Wonchan Choi (PI)**, Assistant Professor, iSchool@UWM
  - [Yan Zhang](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/people/people-details?PersonID=150) (PI), Associate Professor, iSchool@UT-Austin
  - [Besiki Stvilia](https://directory.cci.fsu.edu/besiki-stvilia/) (PI), Professor, iSchool@FSU
- Description: This project aims to provide initial insights into (a) college students’ perceptions and mental models of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT; (b) motivations and use cases of these tools for academic purposes; (c) practices and strategies for evaluating the quality and credibility of information returned by AI-empowered tools; (d) challenges and issues with such tools; and (e) need for support at the instructor, school, and university levels. We will conduct a two-phase study, analyzing log data of ChatGPT-related conversations posted on social question-and-answer (Q&A) sites and online discussion forums and interviewing college students who have used ChatGPT or similar tools for academic purposes. Findings of the study will serve as the preliminary evidence for developing an external grant application to create a theoretical framework of human information behavior in the AI era and inform various stakeholders in higher education—including faculty and instructors, university leaderships, and university librarians—to develop instructional materials, policies and guidelines, and literacy programs that are aligned with college students’ perceptions, behaviors, and needs regarding the use of generative AI tools for academic purposes.

### Developing a Scale for Credibility Assessment on Interactive Web Platforms
- Funding: UWM Research Assistance Fund (September 2023–June 2024), $2,451
- Principal Investigator: **Wonchan Choi (PI)**
- Description: This project aims to collect preliminary data for the development of a new scale for measuring users’ web credibility perceptions based on the established guidelines for scale development and validation.
